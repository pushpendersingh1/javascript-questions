### 1. What are Closure, Lexical Environment & Execution Context in javascript ?
Closure: In JavaScript, closures are created every time a function is created, at function creation time. To use a closure, simply define a function inside another function and expose it.<br/>
Lexical Environment: In JavaScript, every running function, code block, and the script as a whole have an associated object known as the Execution Context: When your code runs in the JavaScript Engine. Each statement of your code is executed in a certain Execution Context. A new Execution Context is created whenever function invocation is there. <br/>

### 2. What is Hoisting ? Are let & const are also hosted in JS ?
Hoisting: It is JavaScript's default behavior of moving declarations to the top.<br/>
All declarations (var, let, const, function, function*, class) are "hoisted" in JavaScript.<br/>
A variable declared by let or const has a so-called temporal dead zone (TDZ): When entering its scope, it canâ€™t be accessed (got or set) until execution reaches the declaration.<br />
